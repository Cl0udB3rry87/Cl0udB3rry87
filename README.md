- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cl0udB3rry87
- 👀 I’m interested in Rust and Python programming, making GUI interfaces, want to get good at web programming, I play the occassional game but lose interest (kinda boring, might need to just make one, more interesting/maybe need more friends to play with), I also like photography, and escaping outdoors.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and Python.  I really want to know how to make a GUI!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Rust and Python tutorials and simple useful programs to code.  If you have any ideas let me know. 
- 📫 How to reach me @Cl0udB3rry87 on Youtube, GMail, Twitch, steam, and Instagram
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I taught myself Apple Basic when I was 8 and did not what I was doing.  Only realized it when I took a QBasic class in high school and it looked really familiar.
